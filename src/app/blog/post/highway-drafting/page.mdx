Recently, I drove to Yosemite. As someone who obsesses over [drag coefficients](https://triathlon-tools.vercel.app/tools/bike-simulator) while cycling, I started wondering about the potential efficiency gains from driving closely behind another car. On a bike, drafting behind someone is significantly easier, since most of your energy is lost to aerodynamic drag. For example, the power output of a rider in the pro peloton can be as much as [40% lower](https://annex.exploratorium.edu/cycling/aerodynamics2.html#:~:text=In%20road%20racing%2C%20bicyclists%20group,not%20drafting%20with%20the%20group.) as someone riding out in front of the group. Is the same true for driving? And if so, how much could _drafting_ reduce the carbon intensity of driving?

### Can autonomous cars safely draft on the highway?

Extremely close follow-distances (and other [crazy](https://www.vox.com/2016/3/29/11324690/self-driving-cars-intersections) traffic maneuvers) could be possible on a road with mostly self-driving cars. Whereas human reaction time is on the order of `\~250 ms`, autonomous vehicles operated by a computer should be able to react to events within tens of ms[^1]. At `80 mph (35.7 m/s)`, a `3m` follow distance gives 84 ms of reaction time – an interval that’s too short for human reflexes to kick in, but long enough for a computer to sense, plan, and actuate a change in its driving. Furthermore, self-driving cars can broadcast their anticipated plans to nearby vehicles, reducing the number of sudden changes to react to.

Altogether, I think it’s very feasible for a group of autonomous cars to safely drive in a convoy, spaced a few meters apart to minimize aerodynamic drag.

### How much could drafting improve fuel economy?

Based on some sparse research (two papers and an episode of Mythbusters), it appears that fuel economy can be improved on the order of `\~30-40%` at highway speeds and an optimal follow-distance of about `\~3 meters`. There are probably a hundred caveats to consider based on vehicle types, the speed you’re driving at, wind, etc, but I’m just interested in a ballpark estimate. For my [analysis](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1h4zbnR3LVJKkgjTBlCDGao-bju3XVBd2lSL7-Iv3gQ0/edit?usp=sharing), I assume a `20-40%` improvement in fuel economy (liters of gasoline per km) is possible. `20%` is my pessimistic estimate, `30%` is average, and `40%` is optimistic. I assume that the car in the front of a convoy still experiences 100% drag, but the cars behind benefit from the fuel economy improvement. This means that the average fuel economy is better for longer convoys of cars, but with diminishing returns.

### The math

My rough calculations can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1h4zbnR3LVJKkgjTBlCDGao-bju3XVBd2lSL7-Iv3gQ0/edit?usp=sharing). Some important assumptions are:

- `26%` of vehicle miles are driven on the highway in the US.
- `80%` of a vehicle’s time on the highway could be spent in an “aero” formation.
- Cars travel in groups of five (an arbitrary choice, but larger groups have diminishing aerodynamic returns).
- In groups of five, the convoy uses `68-84%` of the fuel they would if driving individually.

### The results

**With the assumptions above, drafting could be implemented for `663 billion` vehicle miles in the US, and avoid `49-98 million metric tons` of CO2-eq per year. This is `2.7-5.4%` of US transportation emissions and `0.8-1.5%` of total US emissions.**

### Conclusions

A potential \~1% reduction in US emissions is meaningful, but ranks low on the list of benefits from autonomous vehicles in my view, such as improved safety and [years](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/interactive/2021/commute-calculator-pandemic/) of life not spent commuting.

Also, my hypothetical scenario has a number of obvious problems. It assumes 100% adoption of autonomous cars (could take a while) _and_ that those autonomous cars are gas-powered (I hope this is _not_ the case due to electrificatioj). Finally, by grouping autonomous cars within 3 meters of each other on the highway, we’ve basically… reinvented the idea of a train. But with more expensive sensors, many redundant systems, and almost certainly lower end-to-end efficiency and cost-effectiveness for moving people and matter around.

So, while this was a fun exercise (for me, at least), I don’t think we’ve discovered a promising new climate solution. I'll restate the obvious: decarbonizing transportation in the US requires electrification, renewable generation, batteries, and better public transportation that more Americans will want to use.

[^1]: The reaction time of an AV depends on the rate at which relevant sensor data is sampled. For example, a front-facing radar running at 100 Hz should be able to detect a deceleration in the car ahead on the order of 10 ms, a camera with a framerate of 30 Hz only captures data every 33.3 ms, and so on.
