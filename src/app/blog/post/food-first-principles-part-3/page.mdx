So far, I've covered [trophic levels](https://www.milo.fyi/blog/post/food-first-principles-part-1), the inefficiency of modern food production, and the possibility of an [artificial photosynthesis](https://www.milo.fyi/blog/post/food-first-principles-part-2) revolution, where solar panels and bioreactors become a foundational platform in our food supply.

Due to the far superior efficiency of photovoltaic cells at capturing sunlight, using electricity and microbes to produce proteins could be [10x more land efficient](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2015025118) than growing staple crops like soybeans. It is also true that solar farms can generate many times [more revenue](https://www.carboncommentary.com/blog/2022/10/11/which-is-better-a-hectare-of-solar-or-wheat#:~:text=Energy%20yield%20%E2%80%93%20solar%20PV&text=Total%20energy%20produced%20per%20year%20About%20480%20megawatt%20hours%20per%20hectare.) per hectare than agricultural farms.

So will most of our food be grown with solar panels and steel tanks in the future? I’m no longer convinced.

It’s time to give plants their time in the sun, as it were.

## Wealth printers

Like solar panels, plants are machines that [print out wealth](https://caseyhandmer.wordpress.com/2024/11/09/solar-and-batteries-for-generic-use-cases/) from thin air. They’re self-assembling, biological factories that turn free air and sunlight into a wide variety of complex and useful products.

The set of things you can manufacture using plants is vast: cereals, fruits and vegetables, fats and oils, spices, stimulants, drugs, [vaccines](https://sdgs.un.org/sites/default/files/2024-05/BUYEL_~1.PDF), fibers, wood, fuels, etc. I find it remarkable that [a few gigabytes](https://www.darwintreeoflife.org/news_item/genomes-great-and-small-the-diversity-of-plants/) of genetic firmware[^1] contain the instructions for factories that produce bananas, or avocados, or maple syrup, drugs, or [blue tomatoes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_tomato), or [milk proteins](https://alpbio.com/). Currently, humans mostly discover plants that do useful things and selectively breed or [modify](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-03722-6) them. In the future, we might engineer synthetic plants [from scratch](https://www.aria.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/ARIA-Synthetic-plants-for-a-sustainable-future.pdf), giving them enhanced or novel properties.

## Lower capital costs

While plants might lose in a head-to-head battle with gas fermentation on energy and land efficiency, they are an obvious winner when it comes to capital costs. This is perhaps their biggest advantage; crops are grown [outdoors](https://www.sustainabilitybynumbers.com/p/vertical-farming), and self-assemble from tiny seeds that are easy to distribute.

My time so far at [Synonym](https://www.synonym.bio/) has taught me just how much it costs to build industrial fermentation facilities. The building, bioreactors, tanks, centrifuges, dryers, construction fees, etc, add up to tens or hundreds of millions of dollars. Our financial models often include a multi-million-dollar line item for paint\! Paint\! Each facility involves an incredible number of engineering hours to design and several years to build. Even amortized over 20+ years, the total installed cost of the facility and the cost of capital are a significant fraction of the”fully-loaded” cost-of-goods-sold.

<FigureBfCapex/>
<span className="text-neutral-500 text-sm">
**Figure 1:** An illustrative CAPEX breakdown for an example \~$200M biomass fermentation facility (2,400 m3 capacity, fed-batch, US Midwest, yeast biomass with 75 g/L titer, 120 hour fermentation time, \~10 MT/year production). There are many routes to reducing CAPEX, like standardizing facilities or doing continuous fermentation. But financing large-scale facilities like this will remain a big challenge for fermentation startups. For reference, the output of this facility is equivalent to \~20-30 km2 of US soybeans. But don’t get too excited – it would also need \~20-30 km2 of corn to supply it with sugar feedstock.
The expense and effort involved in building food-grade steel infrastructure makes “low-tech” solutions like plants look all the more attractive. True, modern farming includes some expensive equipment, and places like the Netherlands have a lot of greenhouses. But the infrastructure for conventional farming is relatively cheap, and is already deployed widely. If you develop an improved crop variety, there are [millions](https://ourworldindata.org/land-use) of square kilometers of farmland ready for your innovation to be deployed on with low up-front investment.
</span>

## Lower input costs

Even in a world where fermentation infrastructure is ubiquitous and cheap, it would still be difficult to compete on cost with commodity crops. In the following three sections, I examine the three pillars of our food system: proteins, carbohydrates, and fats.

**Proteins**

For sustainable and affordable protein production, the two competing options in my view are plants (including plant-based meat substitutes) and biomass fermentation[^2].

In this [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1s1-KWnBtnQ66X74uN_AWXpq61v8ViZ2fzfIhICpligI/edit?usp=sharing) and the chart below, I compare the input costs of several protein production scenarios on a `$/kg` dry protein basis:

* Biomass fermentation, using primary glucose (extracted from corn)  
* Biomass fermentation, using upcycled crop sidestreams (see this [GFI report](https://gfi.org/resource/cultivating-alternative-proteins-from-commodity-crop-sidestreams/))  
* Biomass fermentation using [hydrogen-oxidizing bacteria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen-oxidizing_bacteria) (HOBs), which consume H2 and CO₂. I’m assuming the inputs are produced with renewable electricity.  
* Protein isolates of several commodity crops (soy, wheat, and peas). Isolates are similar to the dried and purified biomass you’d get from fermentation.

<FigureProteinOpex/>
<span className="text-neutral-500 text-sm">
**Figure 2:** Comparing the input costs of several fermentation configurations to the total delivered cost (\*\*) of protein isolates from crops and livestock. All approaches are normalized to a functional unit of 1 kg dry protein. Under optimistic assumptions, the input-only costs of fermentation (no CAPEX) are close to the total delivered cost of soy protein isolate, but cheaper than other crops. My takeaway is that biomass fermentation is in the right cost ballpark to become a meaningful part of our protein supply, but probably won’t replace staple crops.
</span>

Critically, I’m comparing the total delivered cost of the crops to the input-only costs of fermentation. This is an unfair comparison that removes CAPEX from the equation and heavily favors fermentation.

For a typical biomass fermentation process (fed-batch sugar), the input costs alone are a little more than the total delivered cost of soy protein isolate\! If you then add in the cost of the facility, labor, debt, fixed costs, profit, etc, biomass fermentation struggles to be cost competitive with crops. The economics of sugar-crop-fed fermentation will always have a fatal flaw – you’re growing plants to feed to microbes to feed to humans, so thermodynamics are not in your favor.[^3]

In my opinion, growing food using sugar crops is a technological dead-end, unless you’re producing products with very unique or valuable properties (e.g cultivated meat, cultivated fat, value-add ingredients) that are difficult to produce and extract from plants[^4].

Upcycled crop residues could bring feedstock costs down a bit, but the potential cost reductions from the [GFI report](https://gfi.org/resource/cultivating-alternative-proteins-from-commodity-crop-sidestreams/) I cited are underwhelming. Anyone who sees cellulosic feedstocks as the key cost unlock for fermentation should ask why we [still don’t have cellulosic ethanol](https://www.volts.wtf/p/whats-going-on-with-biofuels) after 20+ years of effort and billions in funding.

The story is similar for HOBs, where the cost of the H₂ \+ CO₂ \+ NH4 and other media components exceeds the total delivered cost of soy protein isolate. Under optimistic projections for hydrogen (\$2/kg) and direct air capture (\$250/tonne [^5]) in 2030+, HOBs look similar in feedstock cost to sugar fermentation today. I still think it’s worth keeping an eye on companies like Solar Foods and Air Protein. Green hydrogen, DAC, and [green ammonia](https://www.latitudemedia.com/news/catalyst-tea-breakdown-green-ammonia-and-synthetic-methane) are still on their way down the cost curve, and lots of industries have a keen interest in making them cheaper. There’s a chance they outperform our most optimistic estimates.

**Figure 3:** The breakdown of cost-of-goods sold (COGS) for a fed-batch biomass fermentation process. Even without labor, O\&M, taxes, and financing costs, the consumables set a tough lower-bound on cost.
</span>

**Carbohydrates**

For producing carbohydrates, plants are really the only viable solution I know of right now. I’ve [written](https://www.milo.fyi/blog/post/food-first-principles-part-2) about the possibility of cell-free carbohydrate synthesis – replicating photosynthesis in a reactor using enzymes – but I don't believe that process will be cost-competitive any time soon.  

Consider the [ASAP Cycle](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abh4049) as an example, which was experimentally shown to be more efficient than crops at converting CO₂ or other C1 molecules like methanol into starch. In this CO₂\-to-carbohydrate pathway, there are 20+ unique enzymes needed. Each of these enzymes needs to be produced in a microbial host, extracted, isolated, and purified – so you need a mini fermentation process just to supply the reagents for your main process. The enzymes [wear out over time](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2023348118#:~:text=CCR%20is%20the%20number%20of,lactis%2C%20yeast%2C%20and%20Arabidopsis.) and need to be replenished. You probably also need to immobilize them somehow, and physically separate some of the reactions, as in the paper.

Last but not least, enzymes are expensive to manufacture\! I alluded to the failure of cellulosic ethanol above, which was in part due to enzyme costs. The cost of the cellulase (key enzyme) alone can be measured in the dollars per gallon of ethanol. A [2010 report](https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy10osti/47572.pdf) (I struggled to find recent ones without a paywall) claimed that Novozymes had reduced the cellulase costs by 10x to less than \$0.40-0.50/gallon. In their pure form, enzymes can cost [anywhere from](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0168165618300282#:~:text=Enzyme%20prices%20are%20hard%20to,28%20and%2027%25%2C%20respectively.) \$10s` to \$100s per kilogram to manufacture.

It’s also theoretically possible to make carbohydrates using a [chemical](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/sustainable-food-systems/articles/10.3389/fsufs.2020.00090/full) process, but difficult in practice. Even the simplest carbohydrates like D-glucose involve stereochemistry, and stereochemistry generally [requires biology](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-35422-y)[^6].

**Fats**

Everyone likes to blame palm oil for deforestation. But oil palms are incredibly productive, and deforestation would actually be [many times worse](https://ourworldindata.org/palm-oil) if we used any other oil crop as an alternative\! That’s because the next best alternative, rapeseed oil, is about 4x less productive per unit area, meaning that you’d need 4x the land to meet demand.

<iframe
  src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/area-land-needed-to-global-oil?stackMode=absolute%C2%AEion&tab=chart"
  loading="lazy"
  style={{ width: "100%", height: "600px", border: "0px none" }}
  allow="web-share; clipboard-write"
/>

Fermentation is a possible route for producing fat alternatives, since some yeasts and other microorganisms naturally produce lots of lipids. For example, [C16 Biosciences](https://www.c16bio.com/technology) was founded to create a [yeast-produced alternative](https://sustainability.mit.edu/article/clean-alternative-one-worlds-most-common-ingredients) to palm oil, citing the environmental destruction and deforestation it causes.  


<FigureOilsLandUse/>
<span className="text-neutral-500 text-sm">
**Figure 4\.** Left: Comparing the land use required for palm oil production via crops vs. fermentation. A business-as-usual, fed-batch sugar fermentation process does not reduce land use. A land use reduction is only possible if the sugar comes from the most productive sugar beet farms in the world.
</span>

The problem is that fermentation-derived oils are not a win from either a land use or cost perspective. Yeasts are typically fed sugar or methanol, and as far as I can [tell](https://sustainability.mit.edu/article/clean-alternative-one-worlds-most-common-ingredients) from public information, C16 uses sugar. In Figure 4, I [modeled](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1s1-KWnBtnQ66X74uN_AWXpq61v8ViZ2fzfIhICpligI/edit?gid=2046139135#gid=2046139135) the land use of palm oil (world average) vs. an idealized lipid fermentation process. Even if we assume the maximum metabolic efficiency for converting glucose to lipids, a C16-like fermentation process is at least as land-intensive as oil palms[^7]. If you source your feedstock from the most productive sugar beet farms in the world, you could cut land use in half – but I don’t see how C16’s claim of [250x more efficient land use](https://archive.ph/dMUQn) could possibly hold up. Similarly, if we assume maximum metabolic efficiency and $600/ton dextrose, the feedstock costs alone are about double the price of commodity plant oils (Figure 5). For what it’s worth, I’m still rooting for C16 and their peers, and I’d love to see my quick math here proven wrong.

Another option is to use hydrogen and C1 feedstocks (e.g CO₂, methane, methanol) to produce fats with gas fermentation. This opens the possibility for reduced land use, but will only become cost-competitive if renewables, electrolysis, and DAC get really cheap.

The best looking option might be a [chemical process](https://synthesis.capital/insights/how-chemistry-is-being-used-to-produce-superior-alternative-fats-introducing-our-investment-in-savor-foods), not a biological one\! There is no reason you need biology to produce fats; they’re fairly simple molecules consisting of hydrocarbon chains. The petrochemical industry has spent decades figuring out how to synthesize and do useful things with hydrocarbons at industrial scales.

One company pursuing a chemical route to fats is called [Savor](https://www.savor.it/). Their thermochemical process converts CO₂ and H2, which could be sourced with renewable energy, into edible fats. This blog post from [Synthesis](https://synthesis.capital/insights/how-chemistry-is-being-used-to-produce-superior-alternative-fats-introducing-our-investment-in-savor-foods) (one of their backers) lays out the many advantages of their approach: it can be precisely tuned to produce a range of end products, it’s based on mature chemical processes (less scale-up risk), and has a path to price parity with commodity oils.

<FigureOilsCost/>
<span className="text-neutral-500 text-sm">
<strong>Figure 5:</strong> Comparing the input costs of several fermented/synthetic fat production scenarios to the total delivered cost of commodity crop oils. All approaches are normalized to a functional unit of 1 kg fat.
</span>

I made a simple model to compare the C16 and Savor processes to commodity oil crops. Once again, I’m comparing feedstock costs only of C16 and Savor to the total commodity price for the crops. I also make a few simplifications in their favor: for C16 I’m excluding the cost of media components, and for Savor I’m assuming 100% conversion of H2 and CO₂ into triglycerides. For both processes, I’m also ignoring any heat/electricity that’s consumed in the process itself, which could be significant for a thermochemical process.

Under optimistic 2030 projections for DAC and green hydrogen ($2/kg H2 and $250/ton CO₂), Savor’s input costs close to the \~10 year average prices for oil crops. If they use industrial waste CO₂ (\<\$100/ton), things start to look more promising (“CC-CO₂” in the figure). Finally, if they used extremely cheap renewable methane (\<\$10/kcf), like the kind that [Terraform Industries](https://caseyhandmer.wordpress.com/2023/01/09/terraform-industries-whitepaper-2-0/) is working on, they could reduce costs even more.

I think a Savor-like process is the future of sustainable food oil production, but relies on significant cost reductions for green hydrogen and captured CO₂, or renewable natural gas. These inputs need to be much cheaper than oil crops in order to budget for labor, CAPEX, financing costs, process energy, and profit. For now, I’ll defend the unpopular opinion that oil crops are quite good at what they do, and we should engineer them to be even more productive if we can.

## Photosynthesis is speeding up

As the ppm of CO₂ in the atmosphere gets [higher](https://www.CO₂.earth/daily-CO₂) every day, photosynthesis actually [speeds up](https://climate.mit.edu/ask-mit/how-much-human-produced-carbon-dioxide-taken-faster-plant-growth-around-world) in a process called CO₂ fertilization[^8]. Researchers at Berkeley [estimated](https://newscenter.lbl.gov/2021/12/08/plants-buy-us-time-to-slow-climate-change-but-not-enough-to-stop-it/) that the global rate of photosynthesis has sped up by 12% between 1982 and 2020 due to CO₂ fertilization. Because plants evolved at pre-industrial atmospheric CO₂ concentrations, we might be able to improve yields even more by metabolically adapting them to current CO₂ concentrations.

Of course, climate change also leads to more extreme and unpredictable weather. In some places, any “benefits” from CO₂ fertilization are offset by droughts, warmer climates, too much rainfall, etc. So CO₂ fertilization is a bit of a pyrrhic victory; we’re trading a mean for a much higher variance. Our World in Data has a [great piece](https://ourworldindata.org/will-climate-change-affect-crop-yields-future) on the tradeoffs of climate change for crop yields.

## Room to grow

Coming into this research, I assumed that crops must be at a plateau in productivity. Haven’t all avenues for improvement been exhausted by centuries of agriculture? But now I believe there is significant room for improvement – not just in crop yields, but in the industrial capabilities that plants can offer.

## Improving photosynthesis

There is a [theoretical upper bound](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photosynthetic_efficiency) on efficiency of about `~12%` for photosynthesis. The chemical reaction that turns CO₂ into glucose itself (Calvin Cycle) is about `30%` thermodynamically efficient, and plants can only capture and utilize the energy from `~45%` of the sunlight spectrum. Other inefficiencies stack on top of this, like [photorespiration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photorespiration), self-shading, reflection, excess photons that are wasted as heat when sunlight is too intense, and less productive phases in a plant’s life cycle, and so on. As a result, the *practical* efficiency of crops is usually [below 1%](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.1200165), less than 1/10th the theoretical limit.

This [excellent 2011 paper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photorespiration) by Blankenship et. al. lays out a menu of options for improving photosynthetic efficiency.

* You could find variants of the RuBisCO enzyme that are better suited to modern CO₂ concentrations, or more selective for CO₂ in general  
* You could replace the Calvin Cycle (dark half of photosynthesis) with a new and more efficient CO₂ reduction pathway. The [reductive glycine (rGly) pathway](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1096717620301245) is a particularly efficient example that has been implemented in a few organisms.  
* You could bypass photorespiration \- this is what [Living Carbon](https://www.livingcarbon.com/post/photosynthesis-enhanced-trees-grow-faster-and-capture-more-carbon) has demonstrated\!  
* You could redesign the light reaction of photosynthesis so that its two photosystems absorb photons from separate halves of the sunlight spectrum. Instead of competing for photons in the same range of wavelengths, they would operate in tandem across a spectrum that’s twice the width. This could effectively double the theoretical efficiency of photosynthesis, from `12%` to `24%`.

Maybe some of these strategies are dead ends in the idea maze – I haven’t done enough research yet to know for sure. But given the gap between actual efficiencies (\<1%) and theoretical efficiencies (12%[^9]) it seems plausible to me that we could, say, double the rate of photosynthesis in crops. Plants are currently sipping from a firehose of photons.

## Reducing or eliminating nitrogen fertilizer use

About [5%](https://www.nature.com/articles/s43016-023-00698-w#:~:text=Both%20the%20production%20and%20use,2%25%20of%20global%20energy12.) of global emissions come from nitrogen fertilizers[^10] alone, so reducing/decarbonizing fertilizer is absolutely on the critical path of getting to net zero. We can’t just get rid of fertilizer – without it, we [could only feed 3.5B](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0167880903003402) people instead of 8B[^11]. Fortunately, there is a portfolio of strategies for decarbonization, including [applying fertilizer more effectively](https://ourworldindata.org/reducing-fertilizer-use), scaling [green ammonia](https://www.latitudemedia.com/news/catalyst-tea-breakdown-green-ammonia-and-synthetic-methane) production, engineering [nitrogen-fixing bacteria](https://www.kulabio.com/), and [distributed plasma reactors](https://arpa-e.energy.gov/news-and-media/blog-posts/playing-zeus).

<iframe

  loading="lazy"
  style={{ width: "100%", height: "600px", border: "0px none" }}
  allow="web-share; clipboard-write">
</iframe>

Some plants, like soybeans and other legumes, already need less nitrogen fertilizer due to their symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria near their roots. The plants provide sugar to the bacteria in exchange for nitrogen, which I find kind of heartwarming. Companies like [Kula Bio](https://www.kulabio.com/) are enhancing the natural nitrogen fixation capabilities of these symbiotic microbes (e.g Xanthobacter).

Why haven’t all crops evolved this collaborative nitrogen strategy? It costs a lot of energy to fix nitrogen, so plants would need a strong evolutionary reason not to just extract it from the soil for free. Reducing one N2 molecule into 2NH3 requires [at least 16 ATP](https://www.nature.com/articles/ismej201697) worth of energy for the microbe. One molecule of glucose can produce [\~32 ATP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_respiration) through aerobic respiration, so the exchange rate is at best 4 molecules of NH3 per 1 molecule of hard-earned C6H12O6, or 1.5 carbons per nitrogen. For a plant with a 20:1 C:N ratio in its biomass, that would mean that at least 7.5% of energy must go to nitrogen synthesis in the form of sugars secreted at the roots (1.5 carbons spent out of each 20 earned). Luckily, any of the photosynthesis improvement strategies listed above could give plants the additional energy they need\!

An even more elegant strategy would be to [introduce synthetic nitrogen fixation pathways](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10521693/) directly into plants, and researchers are indeed working on this. A challenge is that the key nitrogenase enzymes are damaged by oxygen, which is abundant inside of plant cells. Significant bioengineering work is needed to add oxygen protection, for example by containerizing nitrogen fixation in its own synthetic organelle. The upside of integrating nitrogen fixation into crops would be massive, especially for the [poorest farmers](https://agfundernews.com/with-a-new-grant-from-gates-foundation-legume-technology-aims-to-rescue-africas-deteriorating-soils) who probably can’t afford synthetic fertilizer.

## Molecular farming

A relative newcomer to the alt-protein space is [molecular farming](https://gfi.org/resource/plant-molecular-farming-facts/), where plants are genetically modified to produce non-native proteins of interest. It’s a cool idea – to replace animal products, steal their genetic secret sauce and put them in crops. For example, [Alpine Bio](https://alpbio.com/) recently [harvested](https://agfundernews.com/a-huge-milestone-alpine-bio-harvests-first-large-scale-crop-of-soybeans-containing-casein-proteins) soybeans that contain casein (the key protein in dairy and cheese), [Moolec](https://moolecscience.com/) grows soybeans that taste like pork, and [IngredientWerks](https://ingredientwerks.com/ingredientwerks-produces-meaty-corn-proving-it-can-significantly-reduce-the-high-cost-of-key-alternative-protein-ingredients-with-a-carbon-neutral-footprint-at-industrial-scale/) is adding cow myoglobin (heme protein) to corn.

We can divide most food production into an “upstream” process (growing the biomass) and a “downstream” process (purifying, isolating, etc). Molecular farming reduces upstream processing costs, for all the CAPEX- and OPEX-related reasons I discussed above, but makes downstream processing more challenging. In fermentation, you’re usually separating a protein from a liquid broth, which is relatively easy to do. With molecular farming, on the other hand, you’re separating solid target proteins from solid plant proteins.

I’m more optimistic about molecular farming approaches where the non-native protein adds value to the plant in its whole form, as opposed to approaches where the proteins have to be extracted and purified. I’m excited about products like cheesier soybeans, or fortified tofu with heme iron and B12, or oat milk that performs better in a latte – there are so many possibilities to explore.

## Environmental risks

The biggest downside of crops is their exposure to extreme weather events like droughts, floods, [disease](https://time.com/5730790/banana-panama-disease/), or worst-case [catastrophes](https://allfed.info/) like sun-blocking events. While gas fermentation might be the only solution to a true doomsday scenario[^12], we can and should make crops more resilient to extreme weather. If we imagine weather conditions as a bell curve, I think a sensible strategy would be to develop crops that can survive within a few standard deviations of the mean, and build fermentation facilities for the tails of the distributions.

One of history’s unsung heroes is [Norman Borlaug](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norman_Borlaug), who developed high-yielding varieties of crops in Mexico, India, and Pakistan and turned those regions into net-exporters of food. He made dwarf varieties of wheat that could bear the weight of extra grain, and also combined the genetic disease-resistance of multiple parents into more robust children.

I think climate change will necessitate more of this type of Borlaugian work: creating bespoke crops that solve the problems that the farmers in each region face. Global warming doesn’t make it hotter and drier everywhere; some places will get too little rainfall, some places will get too much, some places will get colder, etc. There won’t be a one-size-fits-all wheat or maize or potato, and we’ll need to develop a library of crops that are suited to each microclimate. Making crop research cheaper and more automated will help us (hopefully) stay one step ahead of climate change and reach underserved markets in places like Sub-Saharan Africa.

## Conclusions

Taking a step back, what can we predict about the future of food? Will it be grown in steel tanks or on cropland? My answer is both, but mostly cropland. And the right answer depends on *what* and *where* you’re growing.

In general, it’s hard to beat the cost, simplicity, and scalability of crops for producing carbohydrates, proteins, and fats for 10B+ people. I think plants will remain the foundation of our food supply, and fermentation/chemical processes will fill in the gaps.

Despite the struggles of plant-based meat substitutes, I think they have the best (only?) shot at competing with real meat on price since they use the cheapest ingredients. Engineering crops with higher yields and enhanced nutritional properties could give plant-based meats the tailwind they need. Adding in fermented or synthetic fats could be a game-changer too. Getting plant-based meats to price-taste-convenience-superiority is the most impactful way to address the 15-20% of global emissions that come from livestock[^13].

Biomass fermentation is a promising route for protein production, but the cost of the inputs alone is comparable to something like soy protein isolate. Layer in CAPEX, labor, financing, etc, and it’s very hard to compete with commodity crops on cost. In regions with very [limited arable land](https://www.worldatlas.com/articles/the-least-agricultural-countries-in-the-world.html) (e.g Singapore, Greenland, Egypt), gas fermentation (e.g HOBs) makes a lot of sense for domestically producing meat, dairy, and other food ingredients.

What about dairy? Plant milks already have \~15% market share despite their green premium. If crops get cheaper and molecular farming adds a more dairy-like option to the list of options, I think plant milks could gain more ground.

A synthetic carbohydrate supply will only be possible if we massively reduce the cost of enzymes. So plants are our only carbohydrate option for the foreseeable future.

For fats, I think a thermochemical process that uses renewable H2/CO₂ or CH4 (like [Savor](https://www.savor.it/)) will start to replace oil crops if those inputs become very cheap. In the short-to-medium term, oil crops will continue to supply most of the worlds fats.

Another agricultural revolution is possible through genetically engineered crops. By improving photosynthetic efficiency, I think it will be possible to double crop yields. Integrating direct or symbiotic nitrogen fixation could eliminate the \~5% of emissions that come from synthetic fertilizer use. And engineering region-specific, resilient varieties of staple crops could help us stay a few steps ahead of climate change while improving outcomes for low-income farmers.

[^1]:  I think firmware is a more accurate analogy for the genome than software, since it’s embedded in the plant’s cells, not easily modifiable at runtime, and operates over the entire organism’s life cycle. Epigenetics might be closer to software.

[^2]:  Biomass fermentation means growing and harvesting whole cells. Precision fermentation means separating and purifying a specific target product from the cells.

[^3]:  A similar analogy is adding carbon capture on top of an industrial process (e.g cement production) to decarbonize it. You will never compete with incumbents on cost by adding things\!

[^4]:  In theory, you could engineer plants to produce most molecules (see the molecular farming section below). But the downstream processing could be impractical giving fermentation a significant advantage.

[^6]:  To recap, the [formose reaction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formose_reaction) produces equal amounts of L-glucose and D-glucose. For whatever reason, biology on Earth evolved to prefer D-glucose. L-glucose tastes like sugar, but we can’t metabolize it.

[^7]:  I recognize that not all land is the same. A big advantage of fermentation is that you can do it anywhere, as long as the feedstock is nearby. So you could produce C16 palm oil somewhere like the midwest instead of Indonesia or Malaysia, where the ecological importance of land is really high.

[^8]:  I wonder what carbon removal companies think about future CO₂ concentrations. If they achieve their mission, we’ll go from more than 420 ppm of CO₂ back down to 280 ppm, a 33% lower concentration. This means that the unit energy costs for DAC will only get higher as progress is made.

[^9]:  And 12% isn’t even a hard limit (see above)\! That’s just the limit within the spectrum of radiation that plants can *currently* use, which could be extended through bioengineering.

[^10]:  While the Haber process is energy intensive, most of the emissions in the fertilizer lifecycle occur during their use on farms. N2O is a potent greenhouse gas\!
